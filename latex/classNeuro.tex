The class \hyperlink{classNeuro}{Neuro} receives input from other neurons in the network, it stores the neurones it has a connection with.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$neuro.\-hpp$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
The class \hyperlink{classNeuro}{Neuro} receives input from other neurons in the network, it stores the neurones it has a connection with. 

\hyperlink{classNeuro}{Neuro} calculates its potential according to the equations presented by the Brunel paper (2000).

\hyperlink{classNeuro}{Neuro} has a method receive that saves the potential received from the neurons in the network/the background noise

\hyperlink{classNeuro}{Neuro} stores the time of the spikes occured in a vector, it also stores the potential in a buffer until they are received after a delay D 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
