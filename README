### INTRODUCTION

This project aims to simulate A neural network. 
The network consists of 12500 neurons, of which 20% are inhibitory and 80% are excitatory. The probability of a connection from one neuron to another is 10%. In addition, all neurons are connected to background neurons outside the network, which act as excitatory neurons from inside the network. 
The "background noise" generated by these is simulated by a Poisson distribution of parameter the external frequency vext per time step of the simulation.

### BUILDING

Place yourself in the build-dir3 directory and execute the following commands in the terminal:

		cmake ..
		make


### RUNNING THE SIMULATION

To run the simulation, execute the generated excecutable by copying the following command in the terminal
                ./simulation

### RUNNING TESTS

Place yourself in the build directory and execute the following commands in the terminal:

		cmake ..
		make
		make test
		
This generates an executable, NeuronSimulation_test, which can be launched for further information. Make tests indicates whether the test passed.
